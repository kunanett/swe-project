A simple game created in JavaFX for my software engineering class at university.

## Rules

At the start of the game there are two kings placed on a 6x8 sized board. Each player controls a piece. The players take turns moving the kings by the rules of classical chess. When a king leaves a field, it cannot be stepped on again. The game ends when one of the players is not able to move anymore. The winner is the player who moved last.

## Usage

JDK 16 and Maven 3 are required.
